I&#8217;m a Unity programmer, and I&#8217;ve been working with Unity for almost three years now. It&#8217;s been a thrilling journey self-teaching the art of game development.

On this website you&#8217;ll find a blog with dev logs and a couple of posts about game design. You can find a neat collection of my projects on my [portfolio](https://hudsonmiears.com/portfolio/).

I&#8217;m currently a Software Development Engineer at Esri. I work on the ArcGIS Runtime SDK, making code samples for Android and doing code health improvements in C++.

Most recently, I&#8217;ve been working on a short narrative game about identity, productivity, and brewing beer. I&#8217;ve made [a couple of videos about it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpHSXFLxATDubOAje6dDKeg?view_as=subscriber).

If you want to talk to me about anything, send me an email at hudson@hudsonmiears.com or contact me on Discord @reizoukin.
