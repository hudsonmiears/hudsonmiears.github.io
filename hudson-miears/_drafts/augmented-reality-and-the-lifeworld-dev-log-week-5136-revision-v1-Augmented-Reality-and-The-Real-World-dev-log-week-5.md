I don't have much in the way of tangible progress for the week as I've been focussed on research and writing, so in lieu of a dev log, I wanted to ramble a bit about the topic of blended spaces, phenomenology, and augmented reality. Essentially, exactly the research that I've been doing&#8212;but with less of the formality of the literature review that I'll be completing this week.

  <em>Note: I'm using the term AR here mostly to refer to mobile augmented reality, ie. technology that overlays digital information on a camera feed, as with ARCore, ARKit, Vuforia, etc.</em>
</p>

I approached this topic coming from the perspective of &#8220;I want to design a meaningful AR experience&#8221;, but it quickly led me into a wealth of literature that touches on what a meaningful AR experience actually means. The project at hand already had a background in David Benyon's writings on blended spaces, but I was as yet unaware of the philosophical grounding behind the theory.

In an [old essay about games](https://hudsonmiears.com/2018/06/04/mimesis-and-mechanics-as-narration/) (in which I was woefully unaware of terminology or any real academic theory on interaction), I talked about video games' unique ability for empathy, in that interaction allows players to relate to characters on the screen in a way that is more real than say, a book or a movie allows. 

But games still have an innate separation between the user and the character. No matter how well the user is able to empathize with the character, there is a very real barrier (ie., the screen, the game world, the controller) between the two. As I'm working through the literature on blended spaces, I come across the idea of presence: the feeling of being amongst the action, there in whatever environment is relevant to the task at hand<span id='easy-footnote-1-141' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://hudsonmiears.com/2019/06/25/136-revision-v1/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-141' title='See Benyon's &#8220;Spaces of Interaction, Places for Experience&#8221; chapter 2.2.1.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Presence is certainly a factor in games&#8212;we talk often about immersion&#8212;but can that barrier ever truly disappear?

It certainly seems to the first time you experience _virtual_ reality. You put on the headset and boot up SUPERHOT, and the room you're in disappears; the people you're with disappear. Even the controller in your hand disappears as soon as you get used to the inputs. A low-poly avatar raises its arm and a sleek gun flashes. You duck instinctively; the bullet passes over your head, and as you crouch low, you notice the leg of a second avatar stepping toward you. It's thirty minutes later and you realize that you've left your friend in meatspace while you play out a Jackie Chan fight scene.

But that's _virtual_ reality, and though the technology is similar, the community is similar, and we group the two together with the hashtag #XR, _augmented_ reality seems to me to offer a quite different experience.

You pull out your phone and open [Brickscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiveminlab.brickscape&hl=en_US), a three-dimensional puzzle much like [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/), and turn on the AR mode. The cubist conundrum settles on the pavement in front of you, and you can walk your real, human body around it to get a different angle. It's fun, but you can also sit in place and rotate the cube with your fingers on the phone screen. After a while, you turn off the AR mode; no sense having the camera on while it drains your battery.

Next you download [Just a Line](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arexperiments.justaline), a Google-made snippet that lets you draw lines around your living room. You walk aimlessly around your house, writing notes on the kitchen counter or making a really, really long snake that slithers from room to room. You get a kick out of recording a video: the camera looks at a blank wall, then turns around to reveal a handdrawn sign on the wall directing you to the next room<span id='easy-footnote-2-141' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://hudsonmiears.com/2019/06/25/136-revision-v1/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-141' title='I admit that I recorded more videos than my friends appreciated.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>. The experience is a bit more tangible than Brickscape; at the very least, the digital creations are tied to real-world locations.

But there's an itch that's waiting to be scratched. You try [ARrrrrgh](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.warpinmedia.arrrrrgh): you hide a treasure chest under a cherry tree, then hand the phone off to your friend a few meters away. With excitement, you tell them to find the treasure. They find it; there's little reward. Yet despite the uninspiring finish, there's some satisfaction to it: the tree was a landmark. It makes sense to hide treasure there.

There's still something missing, though.

For me, the question of a meaningful AR experience tied into the unique feature that AR presents: the real world. With the magic of image recognition and on-device cameras, digital creations can become real. They can become things that you interact with as you move your real body; you can see them against a background, and if you move your eyes off the screen, you can see the same background there.

So why don't the apps I've mentioned above hit the mark? They do exactly that: they place a digital object on a real background. Why don't the puzzle and the drawings feel like they exist in the real world? What's missing from ARrrrrgh?
