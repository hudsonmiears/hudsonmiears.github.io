When I think of a new game idea, it usually starts with a camera perspective. I've been trying to pin down why that's so important, so I wanted to do an exploration of how the camera can function as almost a game mechanic of its own. To do this, I've created a simple 3D platformer in Unity with 4 different cameras, to see how a fundamentally identical level can and should change according to how the player sees the world.

If you don't want to read every detail, take a look at the game and see for yourself!
