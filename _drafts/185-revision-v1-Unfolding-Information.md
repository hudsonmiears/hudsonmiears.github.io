<p class="has-drop-cap">
  I turned in my dissertation almost two months ago. Normally, a big project like this can be draining, and two months later the research, topic, and content can all feel stale and tired. It&#8217;s curious to me, then, that the topics I explored in my Master&#8217;s project&#8212;embedding information in the world, using a phenomenological lens to understand user experience&#8212;still seem to me like a vast and relatively unexplored world ripe for experimentation.
</p>

A key concept reaches out to me from all that research, and I can&#8217;t get it out of my head. It was introduced to me from Tim Ingold&#8217;s The Perception of the Environment: roughly, that we are incorporated in the environment and the environment within us in what he calls _enfoldment_; and beyond that: that we grow to understand the world and its information via the _unfolding_ of the environment around us. 

The _unfolding_ is the key, to me: if you imagine yourself as a tourist in a new city, how do you come to understand it and learn about it?

For some, especially those with a traditional academic background, I think, the answer may be to go to a history museum, or open an article on Wikipedia, and read the infodump of history and curiosities that have been curated for us. _This is what Reykjavik is. You should know [that it was established in AD 870 by Ing√≥lfr Arnarson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk#History), and that [alcohol is expensive at bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk#Nightlife)._

That&#8217;s a fine way to experience a city! But there is another method of travelling Reykjavik: leave your AirBnB, turn right at the end of the alley, and find an [interesting place to eat](https://g.page/icelandicstreetfood?share). Nearby you will see a [statue on a hill](https://goo.gl/maps/p5g6wvtasxLXA5XL8), but you&#8217;re too close to the sea to stand for too long in the icy wind, and anyway you need only know that the man was important enough to have a statue downtown.

I&#8217;m a bit biased towards the latter; that was always my favorite way of being a tourist. Saunter down the city streets and pick out the thing that seems most interesting in the moment. Bit by bit, the culture starts to come alive: you piece together how much the city relies on tourism, how old it is and how the ancient culture informs the modern citizen, how important the church is and how its architecture reflects the native landscape&#8217;s power over the mind.

It is a process that _feels_ like information unfolding before you, exactly as Tim Ingold describes, or perhaps exactly as I interpreted his description, vaguely through the shear of misremembered thoughts and interwoven with the research I was doing at the time.
