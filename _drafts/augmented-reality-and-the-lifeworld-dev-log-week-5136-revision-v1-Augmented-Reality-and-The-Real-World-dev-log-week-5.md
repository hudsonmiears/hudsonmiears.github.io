I don&#8217;t have much in the way of tangible progress for the week as I&#8217;ve been focussed on research and writing, so in lieu of a dev log, I wanted to ramble a bit about the topic of blended spaces, phenomenology, and augmented reality. Essentially, exactly the research that I&#8217;ve been doing&#8212;but with less of the formality of the literature review that I&#8217;ll be completing this week.

<p class="has-small-font-size">
  <em>Note: I&#8217;m using the term AR here mostly to refer to mobile augmented reality, ie. technology that overlays digital information on a camera feed, as with ARCore, ARKit, Vuforia, etc.</em>
</p>

I approached this topic coming from the perspective of &#8220;I want to design a meaningful AR experience&#8221;, but it quickly led me into a wealth of literature that touches on what a meaningful AR experience actually means. The project at hand already had a background in David Benyon&#8217;s writings on blended spaces, but I was as yet unaware of the philosophical grounding behind the theory.

In an [old essay about games](https://hudsonmiears.com/2018/06/04/mimesis-and-mechanics-as-narration/) (in which I was woefully unaware of terminology or any real academic theory on interaction), I talked about video games&#8217; unique ability for empathy, in that interaction allows players to relate to characters on the screen in a way that is more real than say, a book or a movie allows. 

But games still have an innate separation between the user and the character. No matter how well the user is able to empathize with the character, there is a very real barrier (ie., the screen, the game world, the controller) between the two. As I&#8217;m working through the literature on blended spaces, I come across the idea of presence: the feeling of being amongst the action, there in whatever environment is relevant to the task at hand<span id='easy-footnote-1-141' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://hudsonmiears.com/2019/06/25/136-revision-v1/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-141' title='See Benyon&#8217;s &#8220;Spaces of Interaction, Places for Experience&#8221; chapter 2.2.1.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Presence is certainly a factor in games&#8212;we talk often about immersion&#8212;but can that barrier ever truly disappear?

It certainly seems to the first time you experience _virtual_ reality. You put on the headset and boot up SUPERHOT, and the room you&#8217;re in disappears; the people you&#8217;re with disappear. Even the controller in your hand disappears as soon as you get used to the inputs. A low-poly avatar raises its arm and a sleek gun flashes. You duck instinctively; the bullet passes over your head, and as you crouch low, you notice the leg of a second avatar stepping toward you. It&#8217;s thirty minutes later and you realize that you&#8217;ve left your friend in meatspace while you play out a Jackie Chan fight scene.

But that&#8217;s _virtual_ reality, and though the technology is similar, the community is similar, and we group the two together with the hashtag #XR, _augmented_ reality seems to me to offer a quite different experience.

You pull out your phone and open [Brickscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiveminlab.brickscape&hl=en_US), a three-dimensional puzzle much like [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/), and turn on the AR mode. The cubist conundrum settles on the pavement in front of you, and you can walk your real, human body around it to get a different angle. It&#8217;s fun, but you can also sit in place and rotate the cube with your fingers on the phone screen. After a while, you turn off the AR mode; no sense having the camera on while it drains your battery.

Next you download [Just a Line](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arexperiments.justaline), a Google-made snippet that lets you draw lines around your living room. You walk aimlessly around your house, writing notes on the kitchen counter or making a really, really long snake that slithers from room to room. You get a kick out of recording a video: the camera looks at a blank wall, then turns around to reveal a handdrawn sign on the wall directing you to the next room<span id='easy-footnote-2-141' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://hudsonmiears.com/2019/06/25/136-revision-v1/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-141' title='I admit that I recorded more videos than my friends appreciated.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>. The experience is a bit more tangible than Brickscape; at the very least, the digital creations are tied to real-world locations.

But there&#8217;s an itch that&#8217;s waiting to be scratched. You try [ARrrrrgh](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.warpinmedia.arrrrrgh): you hide a treasure chest under a cherry tree, then hand the phone off to your friend a few meters away. With excitement, you tell them to find the treasure. They find it; there&#8217;s little reward. Yet despite the uninspiring finish, there&#8217;s some satisfaction to it: the tree was a landmark. It makes sense to hide treasure there.

There&#8217;s still something missing, though.

For me, the question of a meaningful AR experience tied into the unique feature that AR presents: the real world. With the magic of image recognition and on-device cameras, digital creations can become real. They can become things that you interact with as you move your real body; you can see them against a background, and if you move your eyes off the screen, you can see the same background there.

So why don&#8217;t the apps I&#8217;ve mentioned above hit the mark? They do exactly that: they place a digital object on a real background. Why don&#8217;t the puzzle and the drawings feel like they exist in the real world? What&#8217;s missing from ARrrrrgh?
