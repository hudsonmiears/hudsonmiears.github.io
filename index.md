I'm a gameplay programmer, and I've been working with Unity for more than three years now. It's been a thrilling journey self-teaching the art of game development.

On this website you'll find a blog with dev logs and a couple of posts about game design. You can find a neat collection of my projects on my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at Esri. I work on the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android, using Java, Kotlin, and C++ to create performance-critical GIS tooling for developers.

If you want to talk to me about anything, send me an email at hudson@hudsonmiears.com.
